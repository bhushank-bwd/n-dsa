# Common notes

## Integer

- Positive and negative both includes

## Array

### sorted increasing array

- [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10]
- a[i+1] > a[i]

### sorted decreasing array

- [9, 7, 6, 5, 3, 2, 1, 0]
- a[i+1] > a[i]

### Sorted Non decreasing

- always contains duplicate
- [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 6, 6, 7, 9, 9, 10]
- a[i+1] >= a[i]
- same logic for **Sorted Non increasing**
