| Single Number          | bitwise xor                                                                                         |
| Reverse String         | Half loop with swap (i,n-1-i)                                                                       |
| Remove Element         | x, i pointer and replcae x<sup>th</sup> for input element                                           |
| Move Zero              | as last but fill remaining with zero                                                                |
| Missing Number         | Total sum - partial Sum                                                                             |
| Merge two sorted array | two actual last index and keep largest at last of first and check for if anyone array index exceeds |
| Max Profit             | keep min pointer and max profit                                                                     |
| max consecutive one    | keep two pointer currentCount and MaxCount and check also after loop                                |
| Remove Duplicates      | i and x and replace x<sup></sup> if i greater than x                                                |
|                        |                                                                                                     |
